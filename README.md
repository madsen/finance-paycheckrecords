Finance-PaycheckRecords
=======================

Finance-PaycheckRecords is a Perl module that can parse paystubs from
[PaycheckRecords.com](http://paycheckrecords.com), so you can extract the information from them.  It also includes a function to generate a [Quicken Interchange Format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicken_Interchange_Format) (QIF) record from a paystub.

This is a Git repository where development of Finance-PaycheckRecords takes place.  For more information, visit [Finance-PaycheckRecords on CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Finance-PaycheckRecords/).
